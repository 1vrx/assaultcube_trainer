# First Trainer
my first trainer, including namespaces, pointers, r&amp;w process memory, deref pointers, using headers and multiple files to try keep organization (not working clearly)


ive posted this here to hopefully track my progress and compare in future, maybe someone can use this to get an understanding if they are also stuck on their first trainer [wouldnt recommend using this mess rn]
